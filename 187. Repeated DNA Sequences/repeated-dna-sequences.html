<h1><code style="color: brown">medium</code></h1>
<h3><code>Hash Table | Bit Manipulation</code></h3>
<p>All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.</p>

<p>Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

<strong>Output:</strong> ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
</pre>
