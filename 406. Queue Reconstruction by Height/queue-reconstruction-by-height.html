<h1><code style="color: brown">medium</code></h1>
<h3><code>Greedy</code></h3>
<p>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers <code>(h, k)</code>, where <code>h</code> is the height of the person and <code>k</code> is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h</code>. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
The number of people is less than 1,100.</p>
&nbsp;

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<pre>Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
